## College UPDATE

Im nearing my last 2 quarters here at eastern university, I came here to persue a degree in computer science with a minor in web development,
So far i've finished my minor and am now more focused on front and backend development than I am on software engineering. I'm getting better
every day at what I do and I'm excited to see where my career takes me.

## why does this exist?

- This is a portfolio now, I dont think I will be updating the site itself but I will
  continue to update the readme file with my progress and what I am working on.
